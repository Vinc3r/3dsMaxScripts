## Useless scripts since some 3dsMax updates

### [isolateSelection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vinc3r/3dsMaxScripts/master/isolateSelection.ms)
*useless since 3dsMax 2013*
Show the Isolate Selection dialog on the top-left rather than smack-dab in the middle of the viewport. Replace original Isolate Selection in menus and shortcuts.

### [removeBgdImg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vinc3r/3dsMaxScripts/master/removeBgdImg.ms)
*useless since 3dsMax 2013*
Allow to easily remove a background image assigned to the viewport (alt +b key) (by default in 3dsMax, you can only check/unchek "display background").
