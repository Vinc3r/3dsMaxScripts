###isolateSelection
Show the Isolate Selection dialog on the top-left rather than smack-dab in the middle of the viewport. Replace original Isolate Selection in menus and shortcuts.

###removeBgdImg
Allow to easily remove a background image assigned to the viewport (alt +b key) (by default in 3dsMax, you can only check/unchek "display background").
